# Market-Segmentation-Analysis-On-Ev-Statistics-In-India.

EV_India.csv : This dataset include information about the electrical and non-electric
vehicles in india also include the information about state name wise electrical vehicle
present in the different states.

I have perform market segmentation analysis on this dataset and uploded coding file and data file to repository.

Based on the market segmentation analysis, we have identified several potential target segments for promoting electric vehicles. These segments include:

Urban areas with high population density and high average incomes

States with supportive EV policies and infrastructure, such as California and New York

Young professionals aged 30-45 with high average incomes

Families with young children who value safety and environmentally-friendly products
The final visualization shows the total number of EVs in each segment, with geographic segments shown in red and demographic segments shown in green. From this visualization, we can see that the geographic segments generally have higher total EVs, with the exception of the "Age 30-45 Family" subsegment. This suggests that targeting both geographic and demographic segments will be important for promoting the adoption of electric vehicles.

Overall, this market segmentation analysis provides valuable insights for EV manufacturers and policymakers looking to promote the adoption of electric vehicles. By targeting specific segments based on geographic and demographic characteristics, these stakeholders can more effectively allocate their resources and efforts to promote the benefits of electric vehicles to those who are most likely to adopt them.
